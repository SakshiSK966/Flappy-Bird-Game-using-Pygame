### **Gameplay Mechanics**
1. **Player Control:**  
   - The player controls a bird that moves up when the spacebar is pressed and falls due to gravity.
   - The bird must pass through gaps in vertical obstacles (pipes/poles).

2. **Gravity & Jump:**  
   - The bird falls automatically due to gravity.
   - Pressing the spacebar gives the bird an upward push (jump).

3. **Obstacles:**  
   - Randomly generated top and bottom obstacles (pipes).
   - The gap between pipes remains constant.

4. **Scoring System:**  
   - The player earns points by successfully passing through obstacles.
   - Score is displayed on the screen.

5. **Collision Detection:**  
   - The game ends if the bird collides with an obstacle or touches the ground.
